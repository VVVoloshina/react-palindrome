# react-palindrome
Your task is to create a random string generator. Each value must be 5 characters long.

Configure the generation and display of values every 3 seconds.

When displaying the display value to the user, fulfill the following conditions:
1) if the created value is a palindrome, display it in red;
2) if the created value consists only of numbers, display it in blue;
3) if the created contains 0 do not display it at all.

Use RxJs when setting the display every 3 seconds.
